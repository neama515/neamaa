 <h2> definition: </h2>

<p>A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program.<P> <p>Languages that programmers use to write code are called "high-level languages."<p> This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is recognized directly by the computer hardware.<p>

<p>High-level languages are designed to be easy to read and understand. This allows programmers to write source code in a natural fashion, using logical words and symbols.<p> <p>For example, reserved words like function, while, if, and else are used in most major programming languages. Symbols like <, >, ==, and != are common operators. Many high-level languages are similar enough that programmers can easily understand source code written in multiple languages.<p>

<p>Examples of high-level languages include C++, Java, Perl, and PHP. Languages like C++ and Java are called "compiled languages" since the source code must first be compiled in order to run.<p> <p>Languages like Perl and PHP are called "interpreted languages" since the source code can be run through an interpreter without being compiled.<p> <p>Generally, compiled languages are used to create software applications, while interpreted languages are used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.<p>

<p>Low-level languages include assembly and machine languages. An assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is much more difficult to read than a high-level language. In rare cases, a programmer may decide to code a basic program in an assembly language to ensure it operates as efficiently as possible.<p> <p>An assembler can be used to translate the assembly code into machine code. The machine code, or machine language, contains a series of binary codes that are understood directly by a computer's CPU.<p> Needless to say, machine language is not designed to be human readable.
